## Introduction

Welcome to the enchanting world of Harry Potter! In this project, we embark on a magical journey to explore the captivating characters of the beloved wizarding universe. Leveraging the power of Word2Vec models and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we dive into the essence of these iconic characters to uncover their traits, relationships, and unique nuances.

## Implementation Details

- **Word2Vec Models**: We utilize Word2Vec, a popular natural language processing technique, to represent words as numerical vectors. These vector representations capture the semantic meaning and context of words, enabling us to measure word similarities and identify patterns in the language.

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: To visualize the high-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, we apply PCA to reduce the dimensions and plot the characters' positions in a 3D space. This helps us gain insights into the characters' associations and relationships.

- **Data Collection**: The text data used in this project is sourced from all Harry Potter books. We preprocess the text to prepare it for Word2Vec training.

## Files in the Repository

- **Harry_Potter_Character_Association.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code, visualizations, and character analysis.

- **Harry_Potter_all_books_preprocessed.txt**: Preprocessed text data collected from all Harry Potter books.

- **LICENSE**: License information for the project.

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

- **Requirements.txt**: List of required dependencies for running the Jupyter Notebook.
